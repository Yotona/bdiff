# bdiff

## Notice: This branch is for an incomplete implementation I created in Iced. I'm leaving it around in case it's beneficial to others, but I've decided to try using egui for now and will see how that goes...

A(nother) binary diff tool, targeted toward decompilation and modding projects.

bdiff is currently in the very early stages of development. See the [issues](https://github.com/ethteck/bdiff/issues) for planned features.

## Why?

There's a million other hex viewers out there. Most people in the game decompilation scene use vbindiff, a very dependable but somewhat feature-sparse tool. Over the years, I've started wishing for little things here and there that I wish it could do, and I've also been looking to learn Rust.

## What?

A few things that I feel are sorely lacking from vbindiff which I'd like to accomplish here are as follows:
- Reloading the target file when it changes and displaying updated contents
- Being able to quickly convert highlighted spans to base-10 ints, floats, or other custom datatypes
- Knowing where in a target binary I am looking at in terms of object file, symbol, vram, etc
- Display cutomizations (colors, sizes, options in general)

## Cool!
Aw, thanks! really kind of you to go out of your way to say that on my readme.

Please feel free to contribute too, if you're interested. Help a Rust noob out!
